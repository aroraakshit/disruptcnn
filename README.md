# DisruptCNN
DisruptCNN presents code using the Temporal Convolutional Networks (convolutional neural networks with dilated convolutions, see https://github.com/locuslab/TCN) to make disruption predictions usingthe multi-scale data. Specifically, the Electron Cyclotron Emission imaging (ECEi) diagnostic was used. Please cite:
